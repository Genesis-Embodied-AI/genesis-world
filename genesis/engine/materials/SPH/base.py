    The base class of SPH materials.

    Note
    ----
    This class should *not* be instantiated directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampler : str, optional
        Particle sampler. Defaults to 'pbs', which relaxes the particles to a uniform density inside the shape, at the
        cost of a slower first sampling of each shape, cached afterwards. 'regular' places them on a grid, which leaves
        the surface stair-stepped. 'random' draws them uniformly, which leaves local density fluctuations.
